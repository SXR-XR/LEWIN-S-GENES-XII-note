CHAPTER OUTLINE

## 2.1 Introduction

- structure and function of genes and genomes
- direct manipulation of DNA both in vitro and in vivo in numerous organisms



- restriction endonucleases
  - allow DNA to be cut into precise pieces
-  cloning vectors
  - plasmids or phages used to “carry” inserted foreign DNA fragments for the purpose of producing more material or a protein product

-  genetic engineering 
  - used to describe the range of manipulations of DNA that become possible with the ability to clone a gene by placing its DNA into another context in which it could be propagated
  -  **recombinant DNA** was used as a tool to analyze gene structure and expression



## 2.2 Nucleases

- Nucleases hydrolyze an ester bond within a phosphodiester bond.
  - 核酸酶水解磷酸二酯键中的酯键
- Phosphatases hydrolyze the ester bond in a phosphomonoester bond.
  - 磷酸酶水解磷-单酯键中的酯键
- Nucleases have a multiplicity of specificities. 
  - 核酸酶具有多种特异性
- Restriction endonucleases cleave DNA into defined fragments. 
  - 限制性内切酶将DNA裂解成特定片段
- A map can be generated by using the overlaps between the fragments generated by different restriction enzymes.
  - 利用不同限制性内切酶产生的片段之间的重叠可以生成图谱

### Nucleases

- endonucleases and exonucleases 
-  DNA, as DNases, or RNA, as RNases, or even be specific for a **DNA/RNA hybrid, as RNaseH**
- single-stranded nucleotide chains, duplex chains, or both.



### restriction enzymes

- Nucleases might have a sequence preference

- three different classes of restriction enzymes
  - Types I 、 II and III 
- Restriction enzymes have to do two things: (1) recognize a specific sequence, and (2) cut, or restrict, at or near that sequence.

#### type II restriction enzymes

- most common

- recognition site and cleavage site are the same
  - These sites range in length from 4 to 8 base pairs (bp)
  - inversely palindromic
- Restriction enzymes can cut the DNA in two different ways
  - staggered cut, which leaves single-stranded overhangs, or “sticky ends.”
  -  blunt double-stranded cut, which does not leave an overhang.
- An additional level of specificity determines whether the enzyme will cut DNA containing a methylated base.

- Restriction enzymes from different bacteria can have the same recognition site but cut the DNA differently
  -  One might make a blunt cut and the other might make a staggered cut, or one might leave a
    3′ overhang, whereas the second might leave a 5′ overhang. These different enzymes are called **isoschizomers.**

#### Types I and III enzymes

- recognition site and cleavage site are different and are usually not palindromes
  - type I enzyme, the cleavage site can be up to 1,000 bp away from the recognition site.
  - Type III enzymes have closer cleavage sites, usually 20 to 30 bp away.

#### restriction map

- A restriction map represents a linear sequence of the sites at which particular restriction enzymes find their targets
- A restriction map can be obtained for any sequence of DNA, irrespective of whether we have any knowledge of its function
- If the sequence of the DNA is known, we can generate a restriction map in silico by simply searching for the recognition sites of known enzymes

## 2.3 Cloning

- Cloning a fragment of DNA requires a specially engineered vector.
  - 克隆一个DNA片段需要一个特别设计的载体
- Blue/white selection allows the identification of bacteria that contain the vector plasmid and vector plasmids that contain an insert.
  - 蓝/白选择允许鉴别含有载体质粒和含有插入物的载体质粒的细菌

### recombinant DNA

- Cloning DNA typically involves recombinant DNA.
- There are two different DNAs needed: **a vector, or cloning vehicle, and an insert, or the molecule to be cloned.**
-  two most popular classes of vectors are derived from **plasmids and viruses**
  - safety, selection ability, and high growth rate
    - “Safety” means that the vector will not integrate into a genome (unless engineered
      specifically for that purpose) and the recombinant vector will not autotransfer to another cell.
  - vector DNA ：insert DNA  ≈ 1μg：1μg
  - Both the vector and insert should be restricted with the same restriction endonuclease to create compatible DNA ends.

#### The details and the variables that will affect the process

##### beginning with the insert—the DNA fragment

- restricted genomic DNA
  - either size selected on an agarose gel or unselected, a larger fragment from another clone
    to be subcloned 
  - a PCR fragment
  -  a DNA fragment synthesized in vitro
- The size and the nature of the fragment ends must be known
- the ends blunt or do they have overhanging single strands 
  - Nucleases
- what are their sequences
  - how the fragments were created (what **restriction enzyme[s]** were used to
    **cut the DNA**, or what **PCR primers** were used to **amplify the DNA**)

##### The vector is selected

- what restriction enzyme[s] were used to cut the DNA, or what PCR primers were used to amplify the DNA
- a common type of plasmid cloning vector called **a blue/white selection vector** is used
- This vector has been **constructed with a number of important elements**
  -  **ori, or origin of replication** to allow plasmid replication
    - provide the actual amplification step
  - **resistance to the antibiotic ampicillin**, amp^r
    - allow selection of bacteria 
  - **E. coli lacZ gene**
    - allow selection of an insert DNA fragment in the vector
- The **lacZ gene** has been engineered to contain a **multiple cloning site (MCS)**
  - This is an oligonucleotide sequence with a series of different restriction endonuclease recognition sites arranged in tandem in the same reading frame as the lacZ gene itself.
  - The lacZ gene codes for the β-galactosidase (β-gal) enzyme, which cleaves the galactoside bond
    in lactose
    - It will also **cleave the galactoside bond in an artificial** **substrate called X-gal** , which can be added to bacterial growth media and has a **blue color when cleaved by the intact enzyme**
    - If a fragment of DNA is cloned (inserted) into the MCS, the lacZ gene will be disrupted, inactivating it, and the resulting β-gal will no longer be able to cleave X-gal, resulting in **white bacterial colonies rather than blue colonies**

##### Enzyme cutting

- restriction enzyme in order to generate compatible single-stranded sticky ends
- select different enzymes that recognize different restriction sites
- An enzyme that makes a blunt cut can also be used
  - ligation——less efficient, but still doable
  -  Two completely different ends with different overhangs can also be used if an exonuclease is used to trim the ends and produce blunt ends
    - randomly sheared DNA can also be used if the ends are then blunted for ligation
    - use a type I or type III restriction enzyme, the ends must also be blunted
- use two different restriction enzymes that leave different overhangs on each end
  - neither the vector nor the insert will self-circularize, and the orientation of how the insert goes into the vector can be controlled—— **directional cloning**
-  Select the vector that has the appropriate restriction endonuclease sites

##### combine the two pools of DNA fragments

- vector and insert
  - insert ：vector = 5/10 ：1
    - If you use too much vector, vector–vector dimers will be produced
    - If you use too much insert, multiple inserts per vector will be produced
  -  too large (over ~10 kilobases [kb]) an insert will not be efficiently cloned in a plasmid vector
    -  virus-based vector——alternative
- Ligation is often performed overnight on ice to slow the ligation reaction and generate fewer multimers



#####  Transformation

- DNA is introduced into a host cell
- DNA must be forced into the cell
  - E. coli does not normally undergo physiological transformation
- two common methods of transformation
  - washing the bacteria in **a high salt wash of calcium chloride (CaCl )**
  - **electroporation**, in which an electric current is applied

- Both methods **create small pores or holes in the cell wall**
- only a tiny fraction of bacterial cells
-  It **should not** have **a restriction system or a modification system** to **methylate the incoming DNA**
- The strain should also be compatible with the blue/white system, which means that it should contain the α-
  complementing fragment of LacZ (the lacZ gene contained in most plasmids does not function without this fragment)
- DH5α

##### Select transformed bacterial

- most of which are not wanted because they either contain a vector with no insert or have not taken up any DNA at all
- The transformed bacterial cells are plated on an agar plate containing both the **antibiotic ampicillin** and an **artificial β-gal inducer** called isopropylthiogalactoside **(IPTG)**
- The ampicillin in the plate will kill the vast majority of bacterial cells, namely all of those that have not been transformed with the amp^r plasmid
- **The remaining bacteria can now grow and form visible colonies**
- two different types of colonies: 
  - blue ones that contain a vector without an insert—because β-gal cleaved X-gal into a blue compound
  - white ones, for which the inactivated β-gal did not cleave X-gal and so remained colorless.

#### note

-  False-positive clones, such as those that were formed as **vector-only dimers, must be identified and removed**
- To do so, plasmid DNA must be at least partly purified from each candidate colony, restricted, and run on a gel to check for the insert size
- **Sequencing the fragment** to be absolutely certain a random contaminant has not been cloned is also suggested



## 2.4 Cloning Vectors Can Be Specialized for Different Purposes

- Cloning vectors can be bacterial plasmids, phages,cosmids, or yeast artificial chromosomes.
  - 克隆载体可以是细菌质粒、噬菌体、宇宙粒或酵母人工染色体
- Shuttle vectors can be propagated in more than one type of host cell.
  - 穿梭载体可以在多种类型的宿主细胞中传播
- Expression vectors contain promoters that allow transcription of any cloned gene.
  - 表达载体含有启动子，可以转录任何克隆的基因
- Reporter genes can be used to measure promoter activity or tissue-specific expression.
  - 报告基因可以用来测量启动子的活性或组织特异性表达
- Numerous methods exist to introduce DNA into different target cells.
  - 有许多方法可以将DNA导入不同的靶细胞
